# Shika Bunker
This was a small map design project that i made for the game Garrys Mod. I felt like trying to design a bunker level, that could be used for some simple sandbox play. And so i did! Consists of several fancy features, such as a ICBM, big blast doors, elevators and so on. Feel free to explore it!
